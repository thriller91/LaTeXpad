# Description

A GoogleDocs-like LaTeX live colaborative document editing project.

This project uses **etherpad-lite** to edit the document in real-time, **TeX Live** to make the PDF file, and **PDF.js** to print the document in your page. As etherpad, we use **node** to make it *soon* possible.

# Install

First you have to clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/thriller91/LaTeXpad.git`
You also have to install **PDF.js**
And you need to install **Express**:
`npm install express`
